Custom Cases for JoyCon Style Analog Joysticks

Print the flat sides down. No supports or rafts required. I printed Prusa Medium at 20% infill using Simplify3D.

If you are just printing the STLs, you'll want to flip the Y 180 degrees for the _TOP. 

Model uses two 1.6*4 MM screws to hold the joystick to the case. 
Currently set for 2.5 MM screw to mount the breakout board.
Case holds together with 2.5 MM screws also.

You can adjust the OpenSCAD model for different screw dimensions. Key stuff I put as variables.

At the least, you can use the OpenSCAD to grab the measurements for the joystick, stick mounts, Arduino Pro Micro Mounts, etc. These are very fiddly numbers. Save yourself some time. :-)
